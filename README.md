BACKGROUND
Barley cultivation in Ethiopia has traditionally occurred in two seasons: Belg (February–April) and Meher (June–December). However, changing rainfall patterns in the Horn of Africa are making this increasingly difficult. This region is highly vulnerable to climate change, which is expected to significantly impact food production.

Breeding now leverages big data, integrating genomics, phenotyping, and climate models. By combining genomic data with remote sensing and climate information, researchers can link genetic diversity to environmental conditions, identifying loci for adaptive responses. This can potentially accelerate the development of climate-ready varieties through molecular breeding, genomic selection and decentralized approaches.

Our study explores the diversity of Ethiopian barley landraces, assessing their adaptation potential to current and future climates. Using genomics, climate data analysis, and common garden experiments, we model barley genetic composition across Ethiopia’s climate and geography. We identify vulnerable cultivation areas and conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to target phenology and adaptation traits, providing recommendations for breeding efforts focused on local adaptation.

The material in brief We resequenced 418 purified genotyped derived from 249 barley (Horedum vulgare L.) landrace accessions mantained at EBI. We reconstructed the adaptation of Ethiopian barley to historical and projected climates, identifying areas of future maladaptation. We then run a common garden experiment aiming at the identification of quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) potentially contributing to adaptation and performarce.
